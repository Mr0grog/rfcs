Repo is the interface for working with a qri repository qri repos are stored
graph of resources:datasets, known peers, analytics data, change requests, etc.
Repos are connected to a single peer profile. Repos must wrap an underlying 
cafs.Filestore, which is intended to act as the canonical store of state across 
all peers that this repo may interact with.

```golang
type Repo interface {
  // All repositories wraps a content-addressed filestore as the cannonical
  // record of this repository's data. Store gives direct access to the
  // cafs.Filestore instance any given repo is using.
  Store() cafs.Filestore

  // All Repos must keep a Refstore, defining a store of known datasets
  Refstore
  // EventLog keeps a log of Profile activity for this repo
  EventLog

  // A repository must maintain profile information about the owner of this dataset.
  // The value returned by Profile() should represent the peer.
  Profile() (*profile.Profile, error)
  // SetProfile sets this repo's current profile. Profiles must contain a private key
  SetProfile(*profile.Profile) error
  // PrivateKey hands over this repo's private key
  PrivateKey() crypto.PrivKey
  // A repository must maintain profile information about encountered peers.
  // Decsisions regarding retentaion of peers is left to the the implementation
  Profiles() profile.Store
  // Registry returns a client for interacting with a federated registry
  // if one exists, otherwise nil
  Registry() *regclient.Client
}
```
